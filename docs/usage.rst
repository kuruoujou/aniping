Aniping
=======
Aniping is a front-end for Sonarr which collects the current season's airing shows from Anilist and makes it easy to select and download whatever shows you want to see.

Features
--------

- Uses Sonarr's login so you don't have to build a new account.
- Automatically determines groups subtitling the show to select from.
- Highlight shows to check out later, or add and remove shows from Sonarr.
- Self-hosted, your data isn't stored in some random server somewhere, unless you want it to be.
