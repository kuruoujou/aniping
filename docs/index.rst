Aniping
=======
Aniping_ is a front-end for Sonarr_ which collects the current season's airing shows 
from Anilist_ and makes it easy to select and download whatever shows you want to see.

Aniping is self-hosted, so you don't have to store your data in a random server 
somewhere, unless you want to. It doesn't even store a user account, instead it uses
Sonarr's account system to handle useres, with no special configuration required.

It uses the power of nyaa to determine who is subtiltling a show for you, to make it easy
to decide which group to watch. You can even highlight shows if you don't want to start
watching them just yet, to make them easier to find later.

If you just want to get going, head over to the :ref:`quick-start` to get up and running.
